Impossible.
If dest is a char pointer pointing to the beginning of a char array, during string copy,
    it is possible to verify if the memory area is safe by using a while loop
    that iterates until the null terminating character ('\0') is encountered.
However, if dest is a char pointer unrelated to a string,
    it is impossible to determine whether the referenced value is valid or an uninitialized garbage value.
Therefore, it is impossible to verify if "the destination memory area specified by the caller" is safe (large enough).

this is e.g. code. It is impossible that StrCopy func. attacks src array.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char arr[10] = "asdfasdf";
    char* cpyarr = arr - 3;
    strcpy(cpyarr, arr);

    printf("%s\n", arr);

    return 0;
}

output: "fasdf"


I used pointer notation to implement the str functions.
